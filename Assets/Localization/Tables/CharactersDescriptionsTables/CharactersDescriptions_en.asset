      Brutus and
      Cassius are two former bounty hunters, once colleagues before their imprisonment
      in the State Prison. Likely, many of the prisoners are inside it because of
      them.

      Though colleagues, their styles were completely at odds, as is
      their character.

      Brutus in detail is more of a physical fighter, agile
      and precise, using two swords as weapons.

      As a bounty hunter, Brutus
      should be on the side of the law, since the main task of this profession is
      to scout and capture, dead or alive, the wanted.

      They enjoyed an unprecedented
      reputation, becoming known for their efficiency and discretion, and began to
      be hired by private individuals, especially politicians interested in taking
      out rivals or inconvenient characters, becoming in the shadows fearsome contract
      killers.

      Their latest job involved the killing of a prominent politician
      who was rapidly gaining power, causing the general envy of the ruling class
      of the nation in which he was operating. The two plotted his assassination,
      but were later betrayed and accused by their own principals, who used them
      as scapegoats to gain the consent of the people outraged by the recent death,
      thus being thrown into the meanders of the prison-state.'

      Kaina is
      the scion and eldest daughter of the ruling family of one of the most powerful
      states in the dystopian world in which the game is set. As a female and good-looking
      daughter, she was never considered as heir to the throne despite her strong
      commanding and warrior skills, being rather overshadowed by her less intelligent
      and less talented younger brother.

      From an early age she worked hard
      to stand out in the eyes of her father and king. She rejected her upbringing
      as a princess to train as a soldier, enhancing her body and strength to the
      point of improbability, despite her angelic face.

      In war she proved
      to be a killing machine for her enemies and an unbreakable bulwark for her
      allies, and led her own kingdom to victory several times with the hope of being
      considered for succession. Despite her successes, however, her father always
      refused to recognize her as heir and instead assigned her the task of training
      her own brother to make him stronger.

      Wounded in her pride and consumed
      by jealousy, Kaina ended up killing her brother during a training session,
      cracking his head with a single blow. She never showed regret for the incident,
      and unable to keep her imprisoned because of her physical gifts and the respect
      and fear the soldiers had for her, her father opted to condemn her to eternal
      exile from the kingdom.


      Some of her soldiers followed her and together
      with them she founded a mercenary company that was guilty of the worst war
      crimes, which eventually led to her capture and imprisonment in the center
      of the Prison-State.'

      Jude''s home
      nation is located in the desert, in a particularly hostile terrain marked by
      a social system that consistently benefits wealthy city residents at the expense
      of those living in villages in the middle of the desert, who conversely suffer
      from hunger and thirst.

      Jude was born in one of these very villages,
      and from an early age she showed that she had unerring aim and uncommon agility.
      She used her skills to hunt the few edible animals that inhabited the desert,
      striking them from great distances with stones, slingshots, and improvised
      weapons that in her hands became lethal.

      In adulthood she became attached
      to a group of revolutionaries, led by a charismatic leader who promised freedom
      from the oppressions of the city rulers and a life without hunger and thirst,
      a benefactor who began a war against the status quo. Becoming his sniper, and
      perhaps even his lover, Jude took part in the revolution herself, more out
      of convenience than out of real belief in the cause.

      She was approached
      by the opposing faction, which offered her a large sum of money and a position
      in high society to betray the leader of the revolutionaries and bring him to
      justice. Without a second thought Jude agreed, and the leader was captured
      and sentenced to death.


      On the day of execution, however, the revolutionary
      faction stormed the scaffold and succeeded in freeing him, and then won the
      war after a series of bloody confrontations. Jude was imprisoned and then turned
      over to the State Prison to serve the sentence for his treason until his death.'

      Notably, Cassius
      is not a physical fighter, but a skilled chemist and poison expert, a skill
      that has often come in handy in his work as a bounty hunter and hitman.

      He
      mostly uses his concoctions, but carries a dagger with him to use in an emergency.'
