    m_Localized: "Some anonymous informants have revealed that the prisoner known
      as Brutus grew up in the slums of Urbe, under the protection of a local crime
      boss, before disappearing  following the mysterious and sudden death of the
      latter.\r\nAfter a period of silence and inactivity, during which he likely
      solidified his partnership with Dr. Cassius, who is currently also incarcerated,
      he began his career as a bounty hunter affiliated with the law, coinciding
      with his more lucrative - and illegal - activity as a hitman.\r\nA job gone
      wrong led to his capture and that of Dr. Cassius, resulting in their confinement
      in Kerberos\u2019 Pit as special prisoners.\r\nKilling politicians is never
      a good idea.\r\n"

      Princess, Mercenary \n\nEveryone knows Princess Kaina Adamson, even more so
      the dwellers of battlefields and wars of any sort and relevance.\r\nThe first
      born child of King Adam - ruler of Eden - from a tender age she demonstrated
      a stark propensity for being a leader and for fighting, talents incompatible
      with her being a woman, and thus unfit to sit on the throne.\r\nHardened in
      body and in spirit, she lead her father\u2019s armies to victory many a time,
      with the hope of obtaining his blessing. Instead she was tasked with training
      and teaching her own brother, to make him into the ruler that she would never
      be able to become.\r\nAn \u201CUnfortunate\u201D accident during a training
      session resulted in the death of her brother and the subsequent exile of the
      Princess. She went on to become the leader of a fearsome platoon of mercenaries
      which stained itself with unspeakable war crimes, up until her capture and
      confinement in Kerberos\u2019 Pit.\r\n\r\n"

      Marskman\n\n\nGrown up in the middle of the desert and in poverty, Jude\u2019s
      past is most definitely vague. The first reports date back to the star of Naz\u2019s
      revolution, who had become the voice of the desert peoples that had been forgotten
      and oppressed by the cities\u2019 elites. Many times the records cite a lethal
      presence, capable of keeping entire platoons at bay from inconceivable distances
      with an unnatural precision, a ghost armed with a sniper rifle.\r\nDespite
      the close relationship that tied her to Naz - according to the informants -
      she was the first to betray him for a hefty sum of money and the offer of a
      spot amongst society\u2019s finest.\r\nThe revolutionaries' leader was captured
      and sentenced to be publicly executed, but his people managed to free him on
      the very day of his execution. The war went on and culminated with Naz\u2019s
      victory and Jules\u2019 capture, who got spared and locked up in Dumpyland.\r\n\r\n"

      Scientist, Doctor.\r\n\nThe entire scientific and medical community agrees
      on the fact that Dr. Cassius has been one of the brightest minds of our time.\r\nA
      charismatic and fascinating genius, he occupied a privileged seat at the top
      ranks of society, amongst women, parties and cash. He had everything, and those
      who knew him agree that is what caused an even bigger fall.\r\nWhat surrounds
      this event is nothing but rumors and speculation, but the most circulated theory
      speaks of experiments and practices in alchemy, research beyond the traditional
      scientific techniques with the goal of medically treating human emotions.\r\nAfter
      months of silence and mystery, word of him was heard again in the city of Urbe,
      where he began his partnership with the bounty hunter Brutus following happenings
      and deals that aren\u2019t known to us, up until the day of their capture.\r\nHis
      face is kept covered up as a safety precaution, until we\u2019re able to find
      out what happened to the guards that were able to peek underneath the mask.\r\n"
